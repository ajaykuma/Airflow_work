#Setup Instructions
----------------
#To run a standalone:
--Setup Ubuntu/Centos instances
--Install java11 via 'sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk' or java 8
--Check python version, preferably above 3.6 say python3.8

sudo apt update

--update .bashrc for user
alias python=python3.8
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
#export AIRFLOW_HOME=<airflow_path>

--refresh
source .bashrc

--other packages which ay be required/helpful
sudo apt install git -y
sudo apt install vim -y
sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo apt install wget -y
sudo apt install python3-pip

--Install sqlite which will be required when we initialize airflow for first time.(sqllite for backend db)
sudo apt install sqlite3

--Install venv for virtual env (if we want to use it for our work)
sudo apt-get install python3.8-venv

hdu@mh3:~$ python -m venv my-venv
hdu@mh3:~$ source my-venv/bin/activate
(my-venv) hdu@mh3:~$ pwd
/home/hdu

(my-venv) hdu@mh3:~$ sudo apt install libpq-dev

(my-venv) hdu@mh3:~$ pip install 'apache-airflow[postgres]==2.8.1' \
>  --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.8.1/constraints-3.8.txt"

Commands:
airflow -h
airflow standalone
airflow info
airflow standalone

(my-venv) hdu@mh3:~$ airflow -h
Usage: airflow [-h] GROUP_OR_COMMAND ...

[optional]
--or providing versions..
--Install airflow using constraints file

AIRFLOW_VERSION=2.8.1

--Extract the version of Python you have installed. If you're currently using a Python version that is not supported by Airflow, 
--you may want to set this manually.
PYTHON_VERSION="$(python --version | cut -d " " -f 2 | cut -d "." -f 1-2)"

echo $AIRFLOW_VERSION
2.8.1

echo $PYTHON_VERSION
3.8

CONSTRAINT_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-${AIRFLOW_VERSION}/constraints-${PYTHON_VERSION}.txt"
--For example this would install 2.8.1 with python version: 
echo $CONSTRAINT_URL
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.8.1/constraints-3.8.txt

pip install "apache-airflow==${AIRFLOW_VERSION}" --constraint "${CONSTRAINT_URL}"

[optional ends]

--We can individually start scheduler, webserver etc or start all in one as a standalone

--Install postgres as that's what we want to use.
Using sqlite3 restricts us in context of running multiple tasks.

(my-venv) hdu@mh3:~$  sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

Success. You can now start the database server using:
